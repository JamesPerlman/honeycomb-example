# Honeycomb Take-Home Project

The other devs have just finished the basic structure of a brand new app.  The lead engineer has chosen to use redux + reduxForm for data management, and ReactNavigation for routing.

You are tasked with making a single component called `SelectionView` for the form which lists the options stored in the redux store as `options` and allows a user to select one of the items to add it to the main view.

The file `selection-view.js` is where you should put your code.  The interface for `SelectionView` is defined in `form-screen.js`.

Good luck!

# Running the app:

After cloning this repo, `cd` into the repo directory:

`cd FlatListField`

Then auto-install and link dependencies:

`yarn`
`npx pod-install`

It is recommended to install watchman:

`brew update`
`brew install watchman`
